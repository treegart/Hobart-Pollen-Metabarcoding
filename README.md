# Hobart-Pollen-Metabarcoding
This repository contains the code required to recreate the analysis of the paper 'Decrypting seasonal patterns of key pollen taxa in Hobart, Australia: a multi-barcode metabarcoding analysis' by Tegart et al, submitted to the journal Science of the Total Environment.

This includes the analysis steps following bioinformatic analysis, thus the input for this analysis includes ASV tables, Taxonomy tables, and sample metadata files for ITS2 and _trnL-trnF_. Pollen count data is also included in this analysis but it should be noted that this is not metagenomic data and is not the result of bioinformatic output.

The input files can be supplied upon request by contacting me at lachlan.tegart@utas.edu.au.

The rest of the code is stored in this repository.

Please contact me if you have any questions.
